    <h1>DOCTYPE, html, head, body and title</h1>
    <!--this section is all about the title tag-->
        <h3>title</h3>
        <p>Now we need a set of title tags. Make sure you put this tag in the head tag like this below.</p>
        <img src="/coding/Files about HTML/images/titleincode.JPG" alt="" title="title in code" width="800" height="500">
        <p>To do the title tag first put a less than sign (<) then type "title" then put a greater than sign (>) for the opening tag. For the closing tag type a less than sign (<) then type "/title" then you type the greater than sign (>).</p>
        <p>The title tag by itself does do something to the website it makes the title of your whole website see.</p>
        <img src="/coding/Files about HTML/images/titleinURL.JPG" alt="" title="title in URL" width="700" height="200">
