                <h5>making a variable</h5>
                <p>to make a variable first you type var or let then you can type anything then you type "=" and then you type numbers, words or a boolean (true or false)</p>

                <h5>very important note</h5>
                <p>js has a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion which can insert a semicolon behind the scenes</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h5>how to show your variable</h5>
                <p>variables won't be seen anywhere you look in your web page to show you variable there is only one way console.log below is a link to see back what is console.log. but one thing if you typed it like this console.log("age"); then that is wrong becuase you are litterly putting the word age in the console and it is a string below is a link to what a string is you have to type it like this: console.log(age); to make it show your variable. To your variable name has some words then the wrong way of typing it is this: var camelcase = "Whoo Hoo" the right way of typing it is this: var camelCase = "Whoo Hoo" that is good practice and it is called Camelcase.</p>

            <section>
                <h5>text with a variable name</h5>
                <p>to type some text then a variable first you type what you want to type in double quotes and then you add a plus sign (+) or a comma (,) and then type the variable name. Below is a examples of what i am talking about Note: dear readers if you add a plus sign then at the end of whatever you typed has to have a space if you have a comma then you don't need to do whatever I just told.</p>

                <h5>only doing 1 step</h5>
                <p>remeber when I said there are two steps to making a variable step 1 is declaration step 2 is assignment but you don't have to do two steps at the same time below is an example of what I mean and has a console.log because another example is going to show you how it looks like in the console.</p>

            <section>
                <h5>null</h5>
                <p>if you type something like this: var example = null; it is okay because null means there are no values and if you console.log then it will just show null in the console try it yourself i'm correct.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h5>adding</h5>
                <p>if you want a diffrent number and you don't want to delete the number there is only one way the plus sign (+)! to do this you need to type a variable name that has a number and then you put equals sign (=) and then type a variable name that has a number again and then a plus sign (+) and then the final step you need to put a number which is going to be how much you want to add</p>

                <h5>string capination</h5>
                <p>string capination is when you make a variable that has the name of one variable plus another variable below is what I mean</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h5>example</h5>

            <section>
                <h5>problem</h5>
                <p>a problem you might have is when the string capination doesn't have a space that is totally a problem! okay lets calm down remeber the variable name on the left when you find a plus then you put double quotes with only a space like this: " " and then add a plus at the end like this.</p>

                <h5>2 other variables you can use</h5>
                <p>you can not only use var but also let and const the diffrence is that let you can change the value but if you have const you can not change the value or it is a error what I mean is below</p>
